# MLP simlator (+NeuroSim) V3.0

The MLP+NeuroSim framework was developed by [Prof. Shimeng Yu's group](http://shimeng.ece.gatech.edu/) (Georgia Institute of Technology). The model is made publicly available on a non-commercial basis. Copyright of the model is maintained by the developers, and the model is distributed under the terms of the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Public License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode)

This is the released version 3.0 (Mar. 1st, 2019) for the tool. This version extends the algoritihm weights from (0,1) in V2.0 to (-1,1) in V3.0. Besides, more training algorithms such as momentum method, Adagrad, RMSprop, Adam are added. The digital eNVMs (e.g. STT-MRAM) based synaptical array supports parallel read-out is introduced to reduce latency. 

Developers: Pai-Yu Chen, Xiaochen Peng and Yandong Luo.
